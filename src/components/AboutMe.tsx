          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I'm a passionate junior software engineer with a deep interest in AI,
          real-world problem solving, and full-stack development. I recently
          graduated with a degree in Computer Science and earned my AWS Cloud
          Practitioner certification.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I love building tools that make life easier, whether it's a smart
          productivity app or a community-driven platform for my Gurudwara. I’m
          always learning — currently mastering data structures, Tailwind CSS,
          and secure backend development with JWT.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When I'm not coding, I’m usually mentoring younger students, doing
          seva at the Gurudwara, or studying how tech can empower underserved
          communities.
