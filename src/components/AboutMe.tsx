          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I’m a junior software engineer with a passion for AI, real-world
          problem-solving, and full-stack development. I recently graduated with
          a degree in Computer Science and earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner
          certification.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I love building tools that make life easier — from AI-powered
          productivity apps to platforms supporting my Gurudwara community. I’m
          a fast learner, currently diving deeper into data structures, Tailwind
          CSS, and secure backend development with JWT.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Outside of coding, I mentor younger students, do seva at my Gurudwara,
          and explore how tech can uplift underserved communities.
